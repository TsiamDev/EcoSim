# EcoSim

This is a simulation that tries to simulate many different aspects of an ecosystem, including city activity and weather effects on ground.

It begun as an attempt to learn more about pygame, but now it has become an interest to try and learn as much as possible about python and the wonderful things one can build with it **Multiprocessing ensues**
